 - [x] Decorator-based path-to-regexp router
 - [ ] Middleware support
 - [ ] Simplified, more powerful API for D/O Storage and KV  
 - [x] Simplified KV + D/O interaction
 - [x] WebSocket handling
 - [x] Minimized invokations and compute time  
## 🔋 Tree Shakeable Batteries Available in [pioche-extras](https://github.com/GarrettPeake/pioche-extras)

See the installation section in [pioche-extras](https://github.com/GarrettPeake/pioche-extras) to add prebuilt OAuth, log streaming, and middleware to your project

## 💾 Installation

To install just run
```
npm install pioche
```
Then to implement the features just use them as you would normal pioche controllers and middleware
```ts
export { CustomController } from 'controllers/customcontroller';
import { Router } from 'pioche/routing/router';
import { handleFetch, handleScheduled } from 'pioche/routing/delegator';

Router.register(CustomController, {binding = "CUSTOMBIND"});

export default{handleFetch, handleScheduled};
...
```

## 📕 Background and why Pioche Exists

Cloudflare (CF) workers platform has 3 major offerings:

1. **Workers**: A serverless javascript environment for short lived code. There can be many of the same worker script executing globally at the same time

2. **Durable Objects (D/O)**: A serverless javascript environment for long lived code or code which requires transactional storage. There can only be one of a D/O script globally at the same time.

3. **Workers KV (KV)**: A non-transactional distributed key-value store

Workers are web-facing, D/Os are Workers-facing, KV Workers and D/O-facing.  
**Problem**: There is a cumbersome dispatch process to call a D/O from a worker.

D/Os have an in-memory key value store (D/O storage)  
**Problem**: This store has very similar capabilities but use a separate API from KV. 

CPU time is charged per GB-sec, storage operations are charged per kB transferred, and Workers and D/Os are charged per invokation.  
**Problem**: We want to only use D/Os when necessary and minimize CPU time and invokations.  

**Problem**: There is no routing functionality

These 4 issues alone greatly increase upstart development time and complexity because orchestrating routing between services and resource management while minimizing cost is a huge task that developers shouldn't need to handle.
